Provides prefix ranges over text values for prefix-based lookup and indexing. See the [upstream project](https://github.com/dimitri/prefix) for its API and release history.

## Use with CloudNativePG

Add this image to a PostgreSQL 18 Cluster on Trixie. Choose the Bookworm image tag when the base image uses Bookworm.

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-prefix
spec:
  imageCatalogRef:
    apiGroup: postgresql.cnpg.io
    kind: ClusterImageCatalog
    name: postgresql-minimal-trixie
    major: 18
  instances: 1
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
  postgresql:
    extensions:
    - name: prefix
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-prefix
        reference: ghcr.io/cnpg-extensions/prefix:1.2.11-18-trixie
```

Install the SQL extension in a database with a CNPG `Database` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-prefix-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-prefix
  extensions:
  - ensure: present
    name: prefix
    version: "1.2.0"
```

A SQL check that exercises the installed extension is:

```sql
SELECT prefix_range('foo') @> prefix_range('foobar');
```

## Package, dependencies and maintenance

The image installs PGDG package `postgresql-18-prefix` at the Debian version recorded in `metadata.hcl`. Each image includes `/licenses/runtime-packages.tsv` with the exact extension and runtime package/source versions for that build. Package updates are tracked by Renovate; review changes against the package's control file and rerun the target's build and Chainsaw tests. The package is available for PostgreSQL 18 on both Bookworm and Trixie, amd64 and arm64. It depends on the CNPG PostgreSQL 18 base image and libc; no additional runtime package is installed. The prefix module uses BSD-2-Clause licensing. Its Debian copyright file, including upstream attribution and any bundled component notices, is included under `/licenses/`.

The SQL catalog version is maintained separately from the Debian package version; verify `default_version` in the packaged control file when updating the package.

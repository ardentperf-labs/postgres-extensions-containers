## Review rules

Exact changed paths are checked against the mirror SHA above. Dependency-only
commits are consolidated by area using final cumulative values, rather than
replayed individually. Preserve all downstream extension directories and
metadata, including paths Git pairs with upstream PostGIS through rename detection.

## Conflict decisions

- `dagger/maintenance/image.go` and `image_test.go`: adapt upstream single-component
  version support while retaining the downstream registry and malformed-epoch
  regression test. Add a trailing boundary so `1:pkg-1` cannot fall back to
  matching `1`; accept both `1:8-1.pgdg12+1` and `8-1.pgdg12+1`.
- `renovate.json`: retain downstream. Epoch conversion was already ported;
  upstream's additional nested replacement of `.` with `.` does not change
  the intended template behavior. Preserve downstream stable-release and SQL
  version review rules and `cnpg-extensions` README image matching.
- Restore all extension paths to the downstream base, including automatically
  merged changes. Rename detection paired upstream paths with
  `mobilitydb/system-libs/18-bookworm-os-libs.txt`,
  `mobilitydb/system-libs/18-trixie-os-libs.txt`, `pg-stat-plans/metadata.hcl`,
  and `timestamp9/metadata.hcl`; all are preserved exactly.
- Remove resurrected upstream-only pg-crash, pg-ivm, pgrouting, pgvector,
  postgis, timescaledb-oss, and wal2json paths.
- Exclude new upstream `.gitvote.yml`, `COMPONENT_OWNERS.md`, and the
  component-owner nomination issue template. Downstream `CODEOWNERS`, README,
  security metadata, branding and ownership remain unchanged.
- Adopt the new registry cleanup workflow with upstream's dynamic
  `github.repository_owner` account and downstream metadata-derived image
  names. It deletes only matching testing images older than one week,
  retaining at least the most recent version per image.
- Adopt released CNPG patch versions for smoke tests and manifest selection;
  retain downstream catalog installation in `e2e:install-cnpg`.
- Retain already-current downstream shared image/action/Dagger pins.
  Adopt upstream Ubuntu 26.04 labels in the shared jobs changed upstream.


## Validation

- `git diff --cached --check` passed; no unresolved index entries remain.
- `task --summary` parsed the merged Taskfile.
- Generated the ignored Dagger client with installed CLI v0.21.9; restored
  the unchanged module declaration after generation. With the same dummy
  session variables as CI, `go test ./...` passed in `dagger/maintenance`.
- `task checks:all` passed for all 84 downstream extension targets with no
  warnings. Full log: local `/tmp/upstream-sync-20261009-checks.log`.
- actionlint v1.7.12 passed for all six affected workflows with ShellCheck
  disabled and a temporary config accepting `ubuntu-26.04`. Its bundled
  runner list is outdated; GitHub's current official
  [runner image list](https://github.com/actions/runner-images#available-images)
  confirms that hosted label is available. No repository lint suppression
  was added.
- Executed the smoke-matrix shell against live CNPG tags: result
  `["main","1.29.3","1.30.1"]`. All three selected manifest URLs returned
  Deployment manifests; incomplete `1.30` and prerelease `1.30.1-rc1`
  inputs were rejected by the Taskfile manifest selector.
- Executed the registry-clean image-list shell against all downstream
  metadata: 84 unique nonempty names, all ending in `-testing`.
  No registry cleanup action was executed during validation.
- Reviewed the staged delta: only shared workflows, Taskfile, maintenance
  version parsing/tests, and this new record. All extension files,
  `CODEOWNERS`, README, security metadata and Renovate policy are unchanged.
  Newly added `cloudnative-pg` references only identify upstream CNPG tags
  and manifests; downstream image/catalog identity is preserved.
- Full image builds, cluster E2E smoke tests, and GitHub-hosted CI have not
  been run locally; they remain for PR CI.

A PostgreSQL background worker that can terminate random sessions for chaos testing. [Upstream project](https://github.com/disco-stu/pg_rage_terminator).

## Usage

~~~yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-pg-rage-terminator
spec:
  imageCatalogRef:
    apiGroup: postgresql.cnpg.io
    kind: ClusterImageCatalog
    name: postgresql-minimal-trixie
    major: 18
  instances: 1
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
  postgresql:
    shared_preload_libraries: [pg_rage_terminator]
    parameters:
      pg_rage_terminator.chance: "0"
    extensions:
    - name: pg-rage-terminator
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=pg-rage-terminator-18
        reference: ghcr.io/cnpg-extensions/pg-rage-terminator:0.1.7-18-trixie
~~~

Create an application database through CNPG; the worker needs no SQL extension object:

~~~yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-pg-rage-terminator-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-pg-rage-terminator
~~~

The safe `chance=0` default leaves all sessions alone while confirming the module loaded. A positive chance can terminate any randomly selected TCP-backed session visible to the worker; the extension has no database, role, or application allowlist. Use a positive value only in an isolated ephemeral chaos-test Cluster with no unrelated TCP clients. This component is not a SQL `CREATE EXTENSION` object; check its live setting with `SHOW pg_rage_terminator.chance` through the Cluster's managed PostgreSQL service.

## Package and runtime details

PG18 images use the PGDG `pg-rage-terminator-18` package. Its full Debian copyright notice is carried in `/licenses/pg-rage-terminator-18/`; `/licenses/runtime-packages.tsv` lists the exact package versions and architectures used to supply this payload. C module depends on libc from the CNPG base image. No additional library is bundled. Upstream component source is PGDG `pg-rage-terminator`.

The image supports PostgreSQL 18 on Debian Bookworm and Trixie. Renovate tracks the PGDG package pins in `metadata.hcl`.
